## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">

It is a simple Webpage of a group of students in UEMK, of year 2019-23 studying Btech. The name of the web page is 'IPA-MEMBERS'. Here I have added Facebook Profile link of members of IPA(Impossible Project Association). IPA is a group of Btech students including me which deploys many new projects based on Computer Science. Here in the web page we can clear all the members by clicking on clear all button. If we click on resent then the previous task will be undone. We can also see profile pictures of every group members. It is a very simple web page for our introduction.
